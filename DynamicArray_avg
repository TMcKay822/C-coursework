/* Write a program that asks the user to input an integer named numDoubles.
* Create a dynamic array that can store numDoubles doubles and 
* make a loop that allows the user to enter a double into each array entry. 
* Loop through the array, calculate the average, and output it.
* Delete the memory allocated to your dynamic array before exiting.
